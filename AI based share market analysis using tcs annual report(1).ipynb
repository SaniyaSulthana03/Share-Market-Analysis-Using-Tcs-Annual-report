This approach ensured that \\nstudents not only gained scientiﬁc knowledge but also \\ndeveloped critical analytical skills.\\nAdditionally, IMF facilitated meaningful connections \\nbetween students and TCS volunteers, who guided them \\nthrough complex STEM challenges designed to promote \\nteamwork and problem-solving. In total, 708 students \\nbeneﬁted during FY 2025 by this partnership.\\nBy fostering curiosity, innovation, and collaboration, IMF \\ncontinues to shape the next generation of STEM leaders, \\nproving that knowledge and mentorship can transform lives.\\nCase study\\nInspiring young minds:\\nInnovation through technology\\nIn Japan, elementary and junior high school education is \\nmandatory, ensuring that all children aged 6 to 15 attend \\nschool. While the national curriculum provides a strong \\nfoundation, students often have interests that extend \\nbeyond standard subjects. To bridge this gap, TCS has \\nleveraged its IT expertise to develop engaging educational \\ninitiatives like the TCS’ goIT program, designed to spark \\ncuriosity and enthusiasm for technology among upper \\nelementary students.\\nAs part of this program, students participated in design \\nthinking modules, tackling the pressing issue of global \\nwarming.

The Group \\nestimates the future cost-to-completion of the contracts \\nwhich is used to determine degree of completion of the \\nperformance obligation.\\n  The Group exercises judgement for identification of \\nperformance obligations, determination of transaction \\nprice, ascribing the transaction price to each distinct \\nperformance obligation and in determining whether the \\nperformance obligation is satisfied at a point in time \\nor over a period of time. These judgements have been \\nexplained in detail under the revenue recognition note \\n(Refer note 12).\\n (b) Useful lives of property, plant and equipment\\n  The Group reviews the useful life of property, plant and \\nequipment at the end of each reporting period. This \\nreassessment may result in change in depreciation \\nexpense in future periods (Refer note 10(a)).\\n (c) Impairment of goodwill\\n  The Group estimates the value-in-use of the cash \\ngenerating units (CGUs) based on the future cash flows \\nafter considering current economic conditions and \\ntrends, estimated future operating results and growth \\nrate and anticipated future economic and regulatory \\nconditions.

Judgements include considerations of inputs \\nsuch as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes \\nin assumptions about these factors could affect the \\nreported fair value of financial instruments.\\n (e) Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair \\nvalue)\\n  Measurement of impairment of financial assets require \\nuse of estimates, which have been explained in the \\nnote on financial assets, financial liabilities and equity \\ninstruments, under impairment of financial assets \\n(other than at fair value) (Refer note 8)).\\n (f) Deferred tax assets\\n  A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it \\nis probable that future taxable profit will be available \\nagainst which the deductible temporary differences \\nand tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly, the Group \\nexercises its judgement to reassess the carrying amount \\nof deferred tax assets at the end of each reporting \\nperiod.\\n (g) Provisions and contingent liabilities\\n  The Group estimates the provisions that have present \\nobligations as a result of past events and it is probable \\nthat outflow of resources will be required to settle the \\nobligations.

It hedges \\na part of these risks by using derivative financial instruments in line with its risk management policies.\\n  The foreign exchange rate sensitivity is calculated by aggregation of the net foreign exchange rate exposure and a simultaneous \\nparallel foreign exchange rates shift of all the currencies by 10% against the respective functional currencies of Tata Consultancy \\nServices Limited and its subsidiaries.\\n  The following analysis has been worked out based on the net exposures for each of the subsidiaries and Tata Consultancy \\nServices Limited as of the date of balance sheet which could affect the statement of profit and loss and other comprehensive \\nincome and equity. Further the exposure as indicated below is mitigated by some of the derivative contracts entered into by the \\nGroup as disclosed in note 8(k).\\n  The following table sets forth information relating to unhedged foreign currency exposure as at March 31, 2025:\\n(` crore)\\nUSD EUR GBP Others\\nNet financial assets  2,572  429  115  1,963 \\nNet financial liabilities  (3,557)  (8)  (337)  (347)\\n  10% appreciation / depreciation of the respective functional currency of Tata Consultancy Services Limited and its subsidiaries \\nwith respect to various foreign currencies would result in increase / decrease in the Group’s profit before taxes by approximately'),\n",

The inputs \\nto these models are taken from observable markets \\nwhere possible, but where this is not feasible, a \\ndegree of judgement is required in establishing fair \\nvalues. Judgements include considerations of inputs \\nsuch as liquidity risk, credit risk and volatility. Changes \\nin assumptions about these factors could affect the \\nreported fair value of financial instruments.\\n (e)  Impairment of financial assets (other than at fair \\nvalue)\\n  Measurement of impairment of financial assets \\nrequire use of estimates, which have been explained \\nin the note on financial assets, financial liabilities and \\nequity instruments, under impairment of financial \\nassets (other than at fair value) (Refer note 6).\\n (f) Deferred tax assets\\n  A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent \\nthat it is probable that future taxable profit will be \\navailable against which the deductible temporary \\ndifferences and tax losses can be utilised. Accordingly, \\nthe Company exercises its judgement to reassess the \\ncarrying amount of deferred tax assets at the end of \\neach reporting period.\\n (g) Provisions and contingent liabilities\\n  The Company estimates the provisions that have \\npresent obligations as a result of past events and it is \\nprobable that outflow of resources will be required to \\nsettle the obligations. These provisions are reviewed at \\nthe end of each reporting period and are adjusted to \\nreflect the current best estimates. \\n  The Company uses significant judgements to assess \\ncontingent liabilities.

In assessing whether the \\nCompany is reasonably certain to exercise an option \\nto extend a lease, or not to exercise an option to \\nterminate a lease, it considers all relevant facts and \\ncircumstances that create an economic incentive for \\nthe Company to exercise the option to extend the \\nlease, or not to exercise the option to terminate the \\nlease.

Ind AS \\n109 requires expected credit losses to be measured through a loss allowance. The Company recognises lifetime expected losses \\nfor all contract assets and / or all trade receivables that do not constitute a financing transaction. In determining the allowance \\nfor expected credit losses, the Company has used a practical expedient by computing the expected credit loss allowance for trade \\nreceivables based on a provision matrix. The provision matrix takes into account historical credit loss experience and is adjusted for \\nforward looking information. The expected credit loss allowance is based on the ageing of the receivables that are due and allowance \\nrates used in the provision matrix. For all other financial assets, expected credit losses are measured at an amount equal to the \\n12-months expected credit losses or at an amount equal to the life time expected credit losses if the credit risk on the financial asset \\nhas increased significantly since initial recognition.\\n(a) Investments\\n Investments consist of the following:\\n Investments – Non-current\\n(` crore)\\nAs at  \\nMarch 31, 2025\\nAs at  \\nMarch 31, 2024\\nInvestment in subsidiaries\\nFully paid equity shares (unquoted)  2,423  2,405 \\nOptionally redeemable convertible debentures (unquoted)  1,576  -    \\nInvestments designated at fair value through OCI\\nFully paid equity shares (unquoted)\\nTaj Air Limited  19  19 \\nLess: Impairment in value of investments  (19)  (19)\\n 3,999  2,405 \\n Investments – Current\\n(` crore)\\nAs at  \\nMarch 31, 2025\\nAs at  \\nMarch 31, 2024\\nInvestments carried at fair value through profit or loss\\nMutual fund units (quoted)  1,030  749 \\nInvestments carried at fair value through OCI\\nGovernment bonds and securities (quoted)  23,844  24,746 \\nCorporate bonds and debentures (quoted)  3,929  3,406 \\nInvestments carried at amortised cost\\nCommercial papers (quoted)  -     939 \\n 28,803  29,840'),\n",

Fair values are determined in whole or in \\npart using a valuation model based on assumptions that are neither supported by prices from observable current market \\ntransactions in the same instrument nor are they based on available market data.\\n The cost of unquoted investments included in Level 3 of fair value hierarchy approximate their fair value because there is a wide \\nrange of possible fair value measurements and the cost represents estimate of fair value within that range.\\n The following table summarises financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis and financial assets that are \\nnot measured at fair value on a recurring basis (but fair value disclosures are required):\\n(` crore)\\nAs at March 31, 2025  Level 1  Level 2  Level 3  Total \\nFinancial assets\\nMutual fund units  1,030  -     -     1,030 \\nEquity shares  -     -     -     -    \\nGovernment bonds and securities  23,844  -     -     23,844 \\nCorporate bonds and debentures  3,929  -     -     3,929 \\nFair value of foreign exchange derivative assets  -     390  -     390 \\n 28,803  390  -    29,193 \\nFinancial liabilities'),\n",

The cost of the right-of-use asset measured at inception shall comprise of the amount of the initial \\nmeasurement of the lease liability adjusted for any lease payments made at or before the commencement date less any lease \\nincentives received, plus any initial direct costs incurred and an estimate of costs to be incurred by the lessee in dismantling and \\nremoving the underlying asset or restoring the underlying asset or site on which it is located. The right-of-use asset is subsequently \\nmeasured at cost less any accumulated depreciation, accumulated impairment losses, if any and adjusted for any remeasurement of \\nthe lease liability. The right-of-use asset is depreciated using the straight-line method from the commencement date over the shorter \\nof lease term or useful life of right-of-use asset. The estimated useful lives of right-of-use assets are determined on the same basis \\nas those of property, plant and equipment. Right-of-use assets are tested for impairment whenever there is any indication that their \\ncarrying amounts may not be recoverable.

Impairment loss, if any, is recognised in the statement of profit and loss.\\n The Company measures the lease liability at the present value of the lease payments that are not paid at the commencement date \\nof the lease. The lease payments are discounted using the interest rate implicit in the lease, if that rate can be readily determined. \\nIf that rate cannot be readily determined, the Company uses incremental borrowing rate. For leases with reasonably similar \\ncharacteristics, the Company, on a lease-by-lease basis, may adopt either the incremental borrowing rate specific to the lease or the \\nincremental borrowing rate for the portfolio as a whole. The lease payments shall include fixed payments, variable lease payments, \\nresidual value guarantees, exercise price of a purchase option where the Company is reasonably certain to exercise that option and \\npayments of penalties for terminating the lease, if the lease term reflects the lessee exercising an option to terminate the lease. \\nThe lease liability is subsequently remeasured by increasing the carrying amount to reflect interest on the lease liability, reducing \\nthe carrying amount to reflect the lease payments made and remeasuring the carrying amount to reflect any reassessment or lease \\nmodifications or to reflect revised in-substance fixed lease payments. The Company recognises the amount of the re-measurement \\nof lease liability due to modification as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset and statement of profit and loss depending upon the \\nnature of modification.
